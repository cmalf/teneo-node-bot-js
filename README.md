# 🤔 How To Do

## 🧬 Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmalf/teneo-node-bot-js
```

## 📂 Go To Teneo Bot Folder

```bash
cd teneo-node-bot-js
```

## 🌐 Prepare Proxies:
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure all your proxies are `active` to prevent your account from being `banned` (you can use this tool: [proxy-ip-checker-php8](https://github.com/cmalf/proxy-ip-checker-php) )
- Main proxy in `proxy.txt`
- ✎ᝰ. `Rule`: 1 proxy for 1 account, so if you have 10 accounts, the number of proxies in proxy.txt, should be 10 proxies too.
- Add some active proxy to `proxybackup.txt`. Proxies on This file will be used as a replacement if any proxy in `proxy.txt` (main proxy) fails to connect.

## 🤖 Add Accounts:

- add all your accounts to accounts.js.

## 📚 Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️ Run the Script:

```bash
npm start
```
## 🔐 Login First :

- Option 1 -> The script will try to login to all your accounts and execute all accounts to run with Proxy.
- Option 2 -> Run Directly (single account Without Proxy).
- Option 3 -> If you have logged in previously, the script may reuse the existing session (typically 2-7 days). After this period, re-login might be required.
