# 🤔 How To Do

## 🧬 Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmalf/teneo-node-bot-js
```

## 📂 Go To Teneo Bot Folder

```bash
cd teneo-node-bot-js
```

## 🌐 Prepare Proxies:
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure all your proxies are `active` to prevent your account from being `banned` (you can use this tool: [proxy-ip-checker-php8](https://github.com/cmalf/proxy-ip-checker-php) )
- Main proxy in `proxy.txt`
- ✎ᝰ. `Rule`: 1 proxy for 1 account, so if you have 10 accounts, the number of proxies in proxy.txt, should be 10 proxies too.
- Add some active proxy to `proxybackup.txt`. Proxies on This file will be used as a replacement if any proxy in `proxy.txt` (main proxy) fails to connect.

## 🤖 Add Accounts:

- add all your accounts to accounts.js.

## 📚 Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️ Run the Script:

```bash
npm start
```
## 🔐 Login First :

- Option 1 -> The script will try to login to all your accounts and execute all accounts to run with Proxy.
- Option 2 -> Run Directly (single account Without Proxy).
- Option 3 -> If you have logged in previously, the script may reuse the existing session (typically 2-7 days). After this period, re-login might be required.

## 📢 Additional information

> [!TIP]
> Proxiesfo is stable again after yesterday's server maintenance (on 2025-01-08) <br>
> so I recommend it again


> [!TIP]
> For this type of websocket connection, the bot relies on speed rather than security. For faster connections, SOCKS5 proxies generally offer better performance than HTTPS proxies. SOCKS5 is protocol agnostic, meaning it can handle all types of traffic, not just HTTP/HTTPS. This flexibility can result in faster speeds, It is recommended to use the socks proxy type. However, for other purposes that rely on security such as webscraping,sensitive activities like online banking, HTTPS proxies is better.

  To get a stable Proxy you can use this Platform, plans ranging from $3 to $125 for 6 months, or use your own choice.
  
- Get Proxies IP address Http and Socks
  - Create an account at [proxies.fo](https://app.proxies.fo/ref/8b1abd0f-c734-1602-5985-612caedf4c7b)
  - Go to `purchase isp`  and `buy` a plan according to `your needs`.
    - You can use `cryptocurrency` for `payment`

  - after that you go to the dashboard `Click Generate proxy Button`
  - Now You can change the Proxy format to :
     - `protocol://username:password@hostname:port`
     - or just look the ss below
